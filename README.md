Project Sojourn

What are we doing?
We are building a web app to display the weather along a route given by Google Maps.

How are we doing this?
We are using Typescript to write the web app, and using the Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface), we’ll provide accurate directions for multiple points. We will need to figure out how to get the weather data itself, but then we’ll apply it at different points at approximately the time one will get there.

We’ll also need to figure out how to host this - probably on Google Firebase (a cloud services provider).

Why are we doing this?
This solves a problem that we have personally faced, and that could help a lot of people. We’re going to understand the entire process behind an interactive website.

Technologies that we’ll be using
Typescript
React App
Create-react-app
Use this to create all the dependencies easily
Google Maps API
Possibly a webscraper to get the weather data

Ideal Customer Experience
Someone about to go on a long road trip wants to understand where a safe place to stop is, or whether the journey has massive blocks due to weather. They’ll enter in the start/end location and get accurate navigation instructions. They will also receive weather at multiple points, spaced some standard distance apart (maybe configurable?) that will give an estimate of the weather at that specific point at the time they would likely get there.
